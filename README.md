Markdown Editor plugin for Question2Answer
=================================================

A markdown editor for [Question2Answer](http://www.question2answer.org), based on [q2a-markdown-editor](https://github.com/svivian/q2a-markdown-editor) and [tui.editor](https://github.com/nhnent/tui.editor)

Installation
-------------------------------------------------

1. Download and extract the `markdown-editor` folder to the `qa-plugins` folder in your Q2A installation.
2. If your site is a different language from English, copy `qa-md-lang-default.php` to the required language code (e.g. `qa-tt-lang-de.php` for German) and edit the phrases for your language.
3. Log in to your Q2A site as a Super Administrator and head to Admin > Posting.
4. Set the default editor for questions and answers to 'Markdown Editor'. The editor does also work for comments, but keeping to plain text is recommended.
